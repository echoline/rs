It’s no use going back to yesterday, because I was a different person then.
But I don’t want to go among mad people.
Oh, you can’t help that.
we’re all mad here. I’m mad. You’re mad.
How do you know I’m mad?
You must be, or you wouldn’t have come here.
Begin at the beginning, and go on till you come to the end: then stop.
Why, sometimes I've believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast.
Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?
Who in the world am I? Ah, that's the great puzzle.
Curiouser and curiouser!
I haven’t the slightest idea.
Imagination is the only weapon in the war against reality.
