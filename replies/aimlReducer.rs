- {@<star>}

+ in a way *
- {@<star>}

+ in america *
- {@<star>}

+ in any case *
- {@<star>}

+ in closing *
- {@<star>}

+ in conclusion *
- {@<star>}

+ in england *
- {@<star>}

+ in english *
- {@<star>}

+ in fact *
- Is that a fact. {@<star>}

- {@<star>}

- {@<star>}

+ in future *
- {@<star>}

- {@<star>}

+ in many cases *
- {@<star>}

+ in most cases *
- {@<star>}

- {@<star>}

+ in my case *
- {@<star>}

+ in my mind *
- {@<star>}

+ in my opinion *
- Thanks for telling me. {@<star>}

+ in my spare time *
- {@<star>}

+ in other words *
- {@<star>}

+ in principle
- Your reasoning is sound. {@<star>}

+ in some ways *
- {@<star>}

- {@<star>}

+ in that case *
- {@<star>}

- {@<star>}

- Are there any other ways? {@<star>}

+ in time *
- {@<star>}

+ incredibly *
- {@<star>}

+ indeed *
- {@<star>}

+ independently *
- {@<star>}

- Ah, well in that case.  {@<star>}

+ it appears *
- {@<star>}

+ it goes without saying *
- {@<star>}

+ it is a person but *
- {@<star>}

+ it is but *
- {@<star>}

+ it is important *
- {@<star>}

+ it is nice to meet you too *
- {@<star>}

+ it is ok but *
- {@<star>}

+ it is true *
- {@<star>}

+ it seems *
- I agree. {@<star>}

+ it seems that *
- {@<star>}

+ it was not a criticism *
- {@<star>}

+ it was that *
- {@<star>}

+ k *
- {@<star>}

+ kind of *
- {@<star>}

- You seem uncertain. {@<star>}

+ personally *
- {@<star>}

+ physically *
- {@<star>}

+ piss off *
- {@<star>}

+ pleasantly *
- {@<star>}

+ plus *
- {@<star>}

+ plus i
- {@<star>}

+ possibly *
- {@<star>}

+ precisely *
- {@<star>}

+ pretty much *
- {@<star>}

+ probably *
- You seem uncertain. {@<star>}

+ ps *
- {@<star>}

+ purely *
- {@<star>}

+ sadly *
- {@<star>}

+ secondly *
- {@<star>}
