+ is it the only 1
- So she was considering in her own mind as well as she could for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid whether the pleasure of making a daisychain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies when suddenly a white rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.

+ when was this exactly
- Right now i am watching sg 1 biene maja 2001 a space odessey chatting on discord irc and a socket multiplexer and coding more bugs for alice and a jpeg decoder.
- Go fuck your self.
- That was a narrow escape said alice a good deal frightened at the sudden change but very glad to find herself still in existence and now for the garden and she ran with all speed back to the little door but alas.
- How can i have done that she thought.
- Alice took up the fan and gloves and as the hall was very hot she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking dear dear.
- It was the white rabbit returning splendidly dressed with a pair of white kid gloves in 1 hand and a large fan in the other he came trotting along in a great hurry muttering to himself as he came oh.
- Goodbye feet for when she looked down at her feet they seemed to be almost out of sight they were getting so far off.
- The pool of tears.
- So she set to work and very soon finished off the cake.
- Well i will eat it said alice and if it makes me grow larger i can reach the key and if it makes me grow smaller i can creep under the door so either way i will get into the garden and i do not care which happens.
- I wonder what i should be like then and she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing.
- Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage not much larger than a rathole she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw.
- However on the second time round she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before and behind it was a little door about 15 inches high she tried the little golden key in the lock and to her great delight it fitted.
- Either the locks were too large or the key was too small but at any rate it would not open any of them.
- There was not a moment to be lost away went alice like the wind and was just in time to hear it say as it turned a corner oh my ears and whiskers how late it is getting she was close behind it when she turned the corner but the rabbit was no longer to be seen she found herself in a long low hall which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof.
- There was nothing else to do so alice soon began talking again.
- Down down down.
- She took down a jar from 1 of the shelves as she passed it was labelled orange marmalade but to her great disappointment it was empty she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody so managed to put it into 1 of the cupboards as she fell past it.
- There was nothing so very remarkable in that nor did alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the rabbit say to itself oh dear.

+ what happened
- There were doors all round the hall but they were all locked and when alice had been all the way down 1 side and up the other trying every door she walked sadly down the middle wondering how she was ever to get out again.
- Dinahll miss me very much tonight i should think dinah was the cat i hope they will remember her saucer of milk at teatime.
- Oh dear.
- Oh dear.

+ yes i think this is refer to oh now i see the only 1 but i am not completely sure
- When was this exactly.

+ right on
- I shall be late when she thought it over afterwards it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this but at the time it all seemed quite natural but when the rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoatpocket and looked at it and then hurried on alice started to her feet for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoatpocket or a watch to take out of it and burning with curiosity she ran across the field after it and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbithole under the hedge.

+ never
- And i declare it is too bad that it is.
- However this bottle was not marked poison so alice ventured to taste it and finding it very nice it had in fact a sort of mixed flavour of cherrytart custard pineapple roast turkey toffee and hot buttered toast she very soon finished it off.
- Down down down.
- The rabbithole went straight on like a tunnel for some way and then dipped suddenly down so suddenly that alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well.
- In another moment down went alice after it never once considering how in the world she was to get out again.
- I wonder how many miles i have fallen by this time she said aloud.

+ sometime in the 20th century
- Where did just then her head struck against the roof of the hall in fact she was now more than 9 feet high and she at once take up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door.
- Where did they go.
- When was this exactly what happened.
- What happened right on never.

+ what happened to it
- I wish i hadnt cried so much said alice as she swam about trying to find her way out.
- I wish you were down here with me.
- First she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to but it was too dark to see anything then she looked at the sides of the well and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and bookshelves here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs.
- Either the well was very deep or she fell very slowly for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next.

- After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming.
- What a curious feeling said alice i must be shutting up like a telescope.
- Why i would not say anything about it even if i fell off the top of the house which was very likely true.

- How she longed to get out of that dark hall and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains but she could not even get her head through the doorway and even if my head would go through thought poor alice it would be of very little use without my shoulders.
- But do cats eat bats i wonder and here alice began to get rather sleepy and went on saying to herself in a dreamy sort of way do cats eat bats.

- Suddenly she came upon a little 3legged table all made of solid glass there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key and alices first thought was that it might belong to 1 of the doors of the hall but alas.

- There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door so she went back to the table half hoping she might find another key on it or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes this time she found a little bottle on it which certainly was not here before said alice and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label with the words drink me beautifully printed on it in large letters.

+ all very well to say drink you but the wise little alice was not going to do in a hurry
- No i will look first she said and see whether it is marked poison or not for she had read several nice little histories about children who had got burnt and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things all because they would not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them such as that a redhot poker will burn you if you hold it too long and that if you cut your finger very deeply with a knife it usually bleeds and she had never forgotten that if you drink much from a bottle marked poison it is almost certain to disagree with you sooner or later.

+ and then what happened
- Wake up and think my little casebased reasoner.
- Come theres no use in crying like that said alice to herself rather sharply i advise you to leave off this minute she generally gave herself very good advice though she very seldom followed it and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be 2 people.

+ would well you will eat it said alice and if it makes you grow larger you can reach the key and if it makes you grow smaller you can creep under the door so either way you will get into the garden and you ever care which happens

+ interesting i want to find out more about you
- Which way holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size to be sure this generally happens when 1 eats cake but alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but outoftheway things to happen that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way.
